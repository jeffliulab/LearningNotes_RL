使用学习曲线来衡量RL的性能（参见示例论文P7）

The code and readme are clear and easy to reproduce. I would recommend having learning curves to compare different approaches (e.g., Page 7 of paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347. 

As discussed in class, learning curves are a standard metric to see the efficacy and learning progress of RL agents, and will help us identify which algorithm to use for a particular problem.

Learning curves (reward vs time) or (success rate vs time) are more commonly used as compared to number of steps taken.
